        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Football or soccer as some of you might call it, is a game played with 22 players, 11 on each side.<br> The aim of the game is to score goals by kicking the ball into the other team's goal.<br>
            It involves a lot of running an it is very fun. You can play football with fewer people too, but now during the lockdown<br> I can't play football.</p>

        <p>My inspiration is Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka. You would have read about Abameyang in the "My Favourite Player" section. Now you will hear about Saka. Saka is a 19 year old who is from the arsenal academy, but is one of arsenal's main strikers. Saka has represented England at under-16, under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-21 level.</p>
